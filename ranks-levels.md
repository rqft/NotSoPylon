# Ranks / Levels

Similarly to Rowboat, PyBoat boasts a levels configuration for command usage/feature usage.

Commands are by default defined on normal usage of such commands per needed authority, keep in mind that anyone with the "Administrator" permission can change your server's config, and thus elevate themselves to whatever bot level they desire.

There are currently no commands locked to the absolute server owner, and a member can have a maximum level of 999.

The default defined ranks are as follows:

| Name | Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Blacklisted` | `-1` |
| `Guest` | `0` |
| `Authorized` | `10` |
| `Moderator` | `50` |
| `Administrator` | `100` |
| `Owner` | `200` |

{% hint style="info" %}
Blacklisted users cannot run commands or interact with the majority of modules on the bot!
{% endhint %}
