## What is PyBoat ?

PyBoat is a all-purpose modular discord bot built on top of [Pylon](https://pylon.bot), with the same goals as [b1nzy's rowboat](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/rowboat), and with other custom features:

It is written in TypeScript, and does not inherit any base code from the original rowboat.

Because of this, configuration and commands are quite different, though the feature set is relatively similar.



## What PyBoat isn't

PyBoat is not a tailor-made bot for your very specific use-case.

Features are generally acessible and more configurable than rowboat's features, but PyBoat will never be a bot for a specific server.



## How to

Assuming you already have the bot in your server, head on to the setup guide.



## Support

For human support regarding the bot, please contact metal\#0666 on discord, for now.
