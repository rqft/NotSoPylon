# Antiping

## How it works

The antiping module is a relatively intuitive auto-moderation feature to stop people from mentioning certain users in configured channels!

Keep in mind that **even if someone's mention gets censored, the mentioned user will still receive a ping**, this module is just a moral incentive for your members to not mention specific people.

Once a member sends a illegal mention in chat, the bot will swiftly let them know so, and will add reactions to it's own message that staff members can use to assign punishments to the user for using the mention.

**This module is NOT a anti-spam module!  
It only handles up to 6 mentions per message!**

There is a configurable auto-mute for repeated mentions, and if a user has multiple pending mention punishments, having a staff member click any one of them will remove all the others, since the action will only be applied once!

Similarly, if the user gets auto-muted and you select the "Ignore" or "IgnoreOnce" actions, the bot will also automatically unmute them.
