# How to get the bot

## Currently

Currently, since Pylon doesn't offer a Bring-Your-Own-Bot service, we use the default pylon bot account, you'll have to add it to your server following the normal pylon methods [here](https://pylon.bot) by joining the [pylon beta discord server](https://discord.gg/hC6Bbtj)

After you have Pylon, you'll have to request **metal\#0666** to deploy the bot to your guild using Pylon.

Keep in mind that, both for the initial deploy and for further updates, I must be in your discord guild and have Manage Server in order to be able to push updates.

## After BYOB Launch

After Pylon's Bring-Your-Own-Bot is launched, PyBoat will of course be it's own bot account, though will likely not be completely public at the start.
